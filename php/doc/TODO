There is SO much to do!

- Use common formatting in all source code

- Strip all styles into external css files
- Use a reset.css to start each page, so that all pages start the same
- Use standard naming convention for styles, so it can be themed easily

- Use a real MVC pattern, if justified.  Not sure that it is at this point, as it would require significant PHP memory usage increase to do so.

- Convert to generic php database api

- Use JavsScript to validate contents of forms as needed

- FULLY validate ALL input, not just generic (i.e. make sure number is integer and in range, not just numeric)

- In some places I use a CONTEXT constant, when PHP doesn't allow constants to be redefined, so they need to be changed to variables.  I know this sounds silly, but there actually are valid uses for it, generically.
