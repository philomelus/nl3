Newsledger was designed to help run a newspaper delivery business.

The requirements for running it are:

- Web Server (only test against Apache 2.2)
- PHP 5.2 or above
- PHP MySQLi Extension
- MySQL 5.1.4 or above

First step is to extract the contents of the archive in a location where
your web server can serve its scripts;  It varies by OS and distro, but
is typically something like /var/www/html, /srv/http, or for a shared host
most commonly a public_html in your user's home.

$ tar -xvf nl-{version}.tar.gz

Next, create a database on the mysql server.  Something like this will
work from the command line on a linux host (there are many ways to do this):

$ mysql -u user -p
mysql> CREATE DATABASE `newsledger`;
mysql> {ctrl-d}

Then the next two steps create the tables, and populate the minimal required
data to get it working:

$ mysql -u user -p newsledger <{path}/sql/create-tables.sql
$ mysql -u user -p newsledger <{path}/sql/insert-initial-data.sql

If you are using something like phpMyAdmin, then you'll want to import the
sql/create-tables.sql file into the database's SQL tab (or copy and paste,
whichever is easiest).  Same for sql/insert-initial-data.sql file.

At this point, if everything went good, you should be ready to login for the
first time.  Don't forget to restart you web server if needed.

The only user available at this point is:

login: admin
password: p@ssw0rd

(that's a zero in password, not a capital oh)
